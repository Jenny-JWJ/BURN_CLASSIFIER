# 🔥 BURN_CLASSIFIER

`BURN_CLASSIFIER` is a Python library for analyzing and classifying wildfire burn severity from satellite imagery.

It operates by calculating the **dNBR (delta Normalized Burn Ratio)** from pre-fire and post-fire **NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio)** images. This dNBR layer is then classified into distinct burn severity levels and calculated area.

## 🚀 How to Install

This project relies on `conda` (remember to install it) for environment management. This is the most reliable way to install complex geospatial dependencies like `rasterio`.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jenny-JWJ/BURN_CLASSIFIER.git
    cd BURN_CLASSIFIER
    ```

2.  **Create the Conda Environment**
    This command uses the `environment.yml` file to create a new environment named `geop_env` and install all necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3.  **Activate the Environment**
    ```bash
    conda activate geop_env
    ```

4.  **Run example.ipynb and test_analysis.py**

## ⚙️ How It's Supposed to Work

The core logic of this tool follows the standard methodology used by the USGS (United States Geological Survey) for assessing burn severity.

1.  **Input:** The tool requires two raster GeoTIFF files:
    * A **Pre-fire** NBR image
    * A **Post-fire** NBR image

2.  **Calculate dNBR:**
    The program calculates the **dNBR (delta NBR)**, or the difference in NBR.
    > dNBR = (Pre-fire NBR) - (Post-fire NBR)
    > *(Note: dNBR values are often scaled by 1000 to work with integers)*

3.  **Classification:**
    Finally, the program classifies the dNBR values into different severity categories.

## 📊 Classification Standard

The classification thresholds are based on the **USGS/MTBS (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity)** standard. `local_analysis.py` module should implement similar logic.

**Note:** The **raster values** (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) used in code must map to these categories.

| dNBR Range | Severity Level | Class |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <= -0.251 | Enhanced Regrowth, High | 1 |
| -0.251 to -0.101 | Enhanced Regrowth, Moderate | 2 |
| -0.101 to 0.100 | Unburned | 3 |
| 0.100 to 0.270 | Low-Severity Burn | 4 |
| 0.270 to 0.440 | Moderate-Severity Burn | 5 |
| 0.440 to0.660 | High-Severity Burn | 6 |
| > 0.660 | High-Severity Burn | 7 |

## 💡 Examples

The best way to start is by exploring `example.ipynb`. Below is the part core function code from library, demonstrating how to run the analysis, plot the classified map, and calculate the area for each class.

```python
# Import required libraries
import rasterio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rasterio.plot import show

# --- 1. Define Constants ---

# Path to the classified raster
CLASSIFIED_TIF = "Malibu_classified_local.tif" # Assumes this file exists

# Define the classification map
# This MUST match the logic in your local_analysis.py!
# The 'value' is the pixel value in the raster file.
CLASS_MAP = {
    1: {"name": "Unburned", "color": "green"},
    2: {"name": "Low Severity", "color": "yellow"},
    3: {"name": "Moderate Severity", "color": "orange"},
    4: {"name": "High Severity", "color": "red"}
    # (Add 'No Data' or 'Enhanced Regrowth' as needed)
}

# --- 2. Plot the Classified Map ---

print(f"--- 1. Plotting Map: {CLASSIFIED_TIF} ---")

with rasterio.open(CLASSIFIED_TIF) as src:
    # Create a custom colormap for accurate visualization
    from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap
    
    # Extract colors and corresponding raster values
    colors = [info["color"] for info in CLASS_MAP.values()]
    values = list(CLASS_MAP.keys())
    
    cmap = ListedColormap(colors)
    norm = plt.Normalize(min(values), max(values))

    # Plot the map
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
    show(src, ax=ax, cmap=cmap, norm=norm, title="Malibu Burn Severity")
    
    # Add a legend
    patches = [plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color=c, label=CLASS_MAP[v]["name"]) 
               for v, c in zip(values, colors)]
    ax.legend(handles=patches, loc='lower right', borderaxespad=0.)
    
    plt.show()

# --- 3. Calculate Area for Each Class ---

print(f"\n--- 2. Calculating Areas: {CLASSIFIED_TIF} ---")

with rasterio.open(CLASSIFIED_TIF) as src:
    # 1. Get pixel size (resolution)
    # Assumes the CRS is projected (e.g., UTM) in meters
    transform = src.transform
    pixel_width = transform[0]
    pixel_height = -transform[4] # y-resolution is negative in Affine transform
    pixel_area_m2 = pixel_width * pixel_height
    
    # 2. Read the raster data into a NumPy array
    data = src.read(1)
    
    # 3. Get counts for each unique value (class)
    unique_values, pixel_counts = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)
    
    # --- Print Area Report ---
    print("\n--- Burn Severity Area Report ---")
    print(f"Coordinate Reference System (CRS): {src.crs}")
    print(f"Pixel Area (m²): {pixel_area_m2:.2f}\n")
    print("Value | Class Name          | Pixel Count  | Area (Hectares)")
    print("-" * 65)
    
    total_area_ha = 0
    for value, count in zip(unique_values, pixel_counts):
        if value in CLASS_MAP:
            class_name = CLASS_MAP[value]["name"]
            
            # 4. Calculate area (convert from m² to hectares)
            area_m2 = count * pixel_area_m2
            area_ha = area_m2 / 10000.0 # 1 Hectare = 10,000 m²
            
            print(f"{value:<5} | {class_name:<17} | {count:<12} | {area_ha:>15.2f}")
            total_area_ha += area_ha
        else:
            print(f"{value:<5} | (Unmapped Value)    | {count:<12} | -")

    print("-" * 65)
    print(f"Total Classified Area (Hectares): {total_area_ha:>30.2f}")
```
